# Best_Buy_API_Website
The Website is powered by Best Buy's free API. In order to recieve the information from Best Buy`s website 
 7 individual requests are made determined by the category of products we are requesting.
The requests are received in separate JSON files which are then appended together and converted into one XML file. The website uses XSL, inline CSS for styling,
and a javascript for the navigation functionality
